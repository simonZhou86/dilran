# medical_image_fusion
CSC2529 course project


## To do list:
### Phase 1
- [x] Data preprocessing (normalization)
- [x] create dataloader for image pairs
- [x] model architecture (feature extractor, reconstruction) and loss function
- [x] fusion strategy
- Temporary Done

### Phase 2
- [x] training script
'''diff
- high priority
'''
- [ ] Image fusion (input: two feature maps f1, f2. output: final fused image)

- [ ] Evaluation Metrics (get results)
- [ ] try MRI-PET and MRI-SPECT (least priority)

### Phase 3
- [ ] test script
- [ ] run baseline, get results
